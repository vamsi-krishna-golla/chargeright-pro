            <li><strong>Enel X JuiceBox Pro (80A):</strong> ~$700+ - Commercial-grade for home</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Electrician Labor Costs</h2>
        
        <p>Labor is where costs vary most. Electricians typically charge $75-150/hour, and installation takes 2-6 hours depending on complexity.</p>
        
        <h3>Simple Installation ($200-$400 labor)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Panel is in or adjacent to garage</li>
            <li>Panel has available capacity and breaker slots</li>
            <li>Short wire run (under 25 feet)</li>
            <li>No trenching or major drywall work</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Moderate Installation ($400-$800 labor)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Panel is across the house from garage</li>
            <li>50-100 foot wire run</li>
            <li>Need to fish wire through walls</li>
            <li>Some drywall patching required</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Complex Installation ($800-$1,500+ labor)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Panel needs subpanel or upgrade</li>
            <li>Trenching required for detached garage</li>
            <li>100+ foot wire runs</li>
            <li>Significant structural work</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The Hidden Cost: Panel Upgrades</h2>
        
        <p>This is the budget-killer most people don't see coming. If your electrical panel can't support a 40-60A circuit, you're looking at:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>100A to 200A panel upgrade:</strong> $1,500-$3,000</li>
            <li><strong>Adding a subpanel:</strong> $500-$1,500</li>
            <li><strong>Load management device:</strong> $200-$500 (cheaper alternative)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Do You Need a Panel Upgrade?</h3>
        <p>You probably need one if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your main panel is 100A and you have central AC + electric water heater/dryer</li>
            <li>You have no available breaker slots</li>
            <li>Your panel is a Federal Pacific, Zinsco, or other recalled brand</li>
            <li>Your panel uses fuses instead of breakers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Get a load calculation from your electrician before assuming you need an upgrade. Many 100A panels can handle EV charging with proper load management.</p>
        
        <h2>Material Costs</h2>
        
        <p>Materials are relatively cheap but add up:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wire (6 AWG copper, per foot):</strong> $3-5</li>
            <li><strong>Wire (4 AWG copper, per foot):</strong> $5-8</li>
            <li><strong>60A double-pole breaker:</strong> $15-40</li>
            <li><strong>Conduit and fittings:</strong> $30-100</li>
            <li><strong>Junction boxes:</strong> $10-30</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>For a 50-foot run with conduit, expect $150-250 in materials.</p>
        
        <h2>Permit Costs</h2>
        
        <p>Most jurisdictions require an electrical permit for EV charger installation. Costs vary:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No permit required:</strong> Some rural areas</li>
            <li><strong>Basic permit:</strong> $50-100</li>
            <li><strong>Permit with inspection:</strong> $100-200</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Even if permits seem optional, get one. It protects you legally, ensures safety, and avoids issues when selling your home.</p>
        
        <h2>How to Save Money</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Federal Tax Credit (30%, up to $1,000)</h3>
        <p>The federal EV charger tax credit covers 30% of hardware AND installation costs, up to $1,000. This applies through 2032. Claim it on IRS Form 8911.</p>
        
        <h3>2. State and Utility Rebates</h3>
        <p>Many states and utilities offer additional rebates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>California: Up to $800 rebate (varies by utility)</li>
            <li>Colorado: $500 rebate + utility incentives</li>
            <li>New York: Up to $500 rebate</li>
            <li>Check your utility's website for current offers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. Choose a Plug-In (NEMA 14-50) Charger</h3>
        <p>Hardwired chargers require an electrician. NEMA 14-50 plug-in chargers let you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have an electrician install just the outlet (cheaper, faster)</li>
            <li>Take the charger with you if you move</li>
            <li>Use the outlet for other purposes</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4. DIY the Charger Mounting</h3>
        <p>Even if you hire an electrician for wiring, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mount the charger yourself</li>
            <li>Run conduit (if you're handy)</li>
            <li>Handle permit paperwork</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5. Get Multiple Quotes</h3>
        <p>Electrician prices vary significantly. Get at least 3 quotes. Look for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Electricians experienced with EV charger installation</li>
            <li>Reviews mentioning EV work</li>
            <li>Clear, itemized quotes</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Real-World Cost Examples</h2>
        
        <h3>Example 1: Best Case ($600 total)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Emporia charger: $400</li>
            <li>Panel in garage, 10-foot run: $150 labor</li>

        <p><strong>Level 1 works if:</strong> You drive under 40 miles/day and can plug in every night.</p>
        <p><strong>Level 2 is worth it if:</strong> You drive 40+ miles/day, have irregular schedules, or want the convenience of fast charging.</p>
        
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <h3>Can I install an EV charger myself?</h3>
        <p>Legally, it depends on your jurisdiction. Many areas allow homeowners to do their own electrical work with a permit. However, working in an electrical panel is dangerous. If you're not experienced with electrical work, hire a professional. The cost savings aren't worth the risk.</p>
        
        <h3>How long does installation take?</h3>
        <p>A simple installation takes 2-3 hours. Complex installations (panel upgrades, trenching) can take 1-2 days.</p>
        
        <h3>Do I need a dedicated circuit?</h3>
        <p>Yes. EV chargers require a dedicated circuit—no other devices on the same breaker. This is code requirement, not optional.</p>
        
        <h3>Should I get a hardwired or plug-in charger?</h3>
        <p>Plug-in (NEMA 14-50) chargers offer flexibility—you can take them when you move. Hardwired chargers look cleaner and are required for some high-amperage units. Both work equally well for charging.</p>
        
        <h3>Will installing a charger increase my home value?</h3>
        <p>Yes, especially in EV-heavy markets. Studies show homes with EV chargers sell faster and for slightly higher prices. It's becoming an expected feature in many areas.</p>
        
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Check your electrical panel</strong> - Do you have capacity and space?</li>
            <li><strong>Measure the distance</strong> - How far from panel to charger location?</li>
            <li><strong>Get 3 electrician quotes</strong> - Ask specifically about EV charger experience</li>
            <li><strong>Research rebates</strong> - Check federal, state, and utility incentives</li>
            <li><strong>Choose your charger</strong> - Match amperage to your needs and budget</li>
        </ol>
